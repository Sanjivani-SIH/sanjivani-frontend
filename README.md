# Sanjivani Frontend

## Overview
This is the frontend of the Sanjivani project, developed as part of SIH 2025 Problem Statement 25108: "Development of AI-powered FRA Atlas and WebGIS-based Decision Support System (DSS) for Integrated Monitoring of Forest Rights Act (FRA) Implementation."

The frontend is built using React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It provides a modern, responsive, and user-friendly interface for interacting with the FRA Atlas, Decision Support System, and other modules.

## Features
- Authentication and secure login
- Interactive dashboards and visualizations
- WebGIS map integration for spatial data
- Access to digitized FRA records and asset maps
- Scheme recommendation and DSS features
- Multi-language and dark mode support

## Project Status
This project is a work in progress. Features are being implemented and improved iteratively. Some modules may be incomplete or under development.

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
3. The app will be available at http://localhost:5173/

## SIH 2025 Problem Statement
25108: Development of AI-powered FRA Atlas and WebGIS-based Decision Support System (DSS) for Integrated Monitoring of Forest Rights Act (FRA) Implementation. (States: Madhya Pradesh, Tripura, Odisha, Telangana)

### Problem Background
The Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006 recognizes the rights of forest-dwelling communities over land and forest resources. However, significant challenges persist:
- Legacy records are scattered, non-digitized, and hard to verify
- No centralized, real-time visual repository (FRA Atlas)
- Lack of integration with satellite-based asset mapping
- No DSS for layering Central Sector Schemes (CSS) benefits for FRA patta holders

### Project Objectives
- Digitize and standardize legacy data
- Create an FRA Atlas using AI and satellite data
- Integrate a WebGIS portal
- Use AI/ML for asset mapping
- Build a DSS for scheme recommendations

### Target Users
- Ministry of Tribal Affairs
- District/State Welfare Departments
- Forest and Revenue Departments
- NGOs working with tribal communities

### Contact & Resources
